# AND_p4_bakeKing
## Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree project 4 


## Project Overview
This project task was to create an Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. The goal was to allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it. The app handles media loading, verifying the user interfaces with UI tests, and integrating third party libraries.
